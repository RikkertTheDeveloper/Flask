### What is Flask?
Flask is a lightweight testing suite written by <a href="https://github.com/RikkertTheDeveloper">Rick Arendsen</a>, and is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest">Jest Testing Suite</a> to preform unit tests in unison.

### What can flask do?
At the moment, flask consists of two simply libraries, **generation** and **globals**, generation can be used for generating new tests. And the global library has a list of assertions to use on your tests. 

### How can I run the test suite?
After adding flask to a project, simply run:
```
node flask
```

After running this command, flask will initiate the testing process.
